Trying to figure out possible tests and what order we need to do them in.
Going off of the outline of the LRM we have the following categories:

*Types
** Primitive Types
** Collection Types
* Lexical
** ~~Comments~~
** Operators
** Literal Types
** Arrays
** Maps
* Expressions
** Operators
*** Arithmatic (needs numeric types)

*** Inequalitied (needs numeric types)
*** Logical operators (needs boolean types)
*** String concat (needs string type)
* Blocks & Statments
** ~~Blocks~~
** Spread (should do last)
** Jam (Should do last)
** Conditional (needs boolean expr)
** While (needs boolean expr)
** For (needs boolean expr)
** ~~Print~~
