## Possible Tests

> Trying to figure out possible tests and what order we need to do them in.
> Going off of the outline of the LRM we have the following categories:

    * Primitive Types
        * ~~long~~ (Fred)
        * ~~double~~ (Fred)
        * ~~string~~(Rotem)
        * ~~boolean~~ (Rotem) 
        * ~~null (Robert)~~ 
    * Collection Types
        * ~~Map~~ (Jose)
        * ~~Array~~ (Robert)
    * ~~Globals~~ (Rotem)
* Lexical
    * ~~Comments~~
    * Operators (Hahn)
        * PBJ Op (Robert)
